										<h3>The Goal</h3>
											<p>The goal for this praticular webpage was to update it to have a modern look and feel. As well as make the webpage responsive on mobile devices.</p>
										<h3>The Tools</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Teamsite</li>
												<li>Robohead</li>
												<li>Adobe Dreamweaver</li>
												<li>HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript</li>
												<li>Bootstrap</li>
												<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
											</ul>
										<h3>The Process</h3>
											<p>I received the initial request via Robohead to update the older version of the Seasoned Loan Offerings webpage. I was provided a rough wireframe of what client would like the page to look, as well as an accompanying Excel Spreadsheet that contained the graphics for the updated webpage. </p>
											<p>                                            
												First, I had to clip the provided graphic images from the excel sheet and size them properly for the web page using Adobe Photoshop. Once the graphics were ready for the web, I designed a prototype of the webpage based on their provided criteria (Grid based layout, graph launching into a modal onclick, and mobile first design) and sent them a link over for review.
												</p>
											<p> 									Lastly, once the prototype was approved in review, I sent the staged web page over to QA for any last minute additions or changes.
											</p>
										<h3>The Challenges</h3>
											<p>One of the biggest issues was building it without having an approved design. Usually, the development team is provided an approved design from the web design team before building a webpage, especially for the main site. However, for this webpage, the client wanted it up and running by Freddie Mac's 50 year anniversary.</p> 
											<p> In order to overcome this challenge, I was in close communication with the client. Providing prototypes and quickly iterating on the page based on their feedback on the previous prototype.</p>
										<h3>The Result</h3>
											<p>The page launched without a hitch in preparation for Freddie Mac's anniversary. The page presented to the user was modern and easy to use on desktop and mobile. It satisfies the client's goals for the look and feel of the page, as well as it's functionality.</p>
