												<h3>Seasoned Loan Offerings</h3>
											</div>
											<div class="desktop col-8 col-8-medium col-12-small">
												<a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/seasonedloanofferings/index.html" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/season-loan-desktop.png" alt=""></a>

										<h4>The Goal</h4>
											<p>The goal for this praticular webpage was to update it to have a modern look and feel. As well as make the webpage responsive on mobile devices.</p>
										<h4>The Tools</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Teamsite</li>
												<li>Robohead</li>
												<li>Adobe Dreamweaver</li>
												<li>HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript</li>
												<li>Bootstrap</li>
												<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
											</ul>
										<h4>The Process</h4>
											<p>I received the initial request via Robohead to update the older version of the Seasoned Loan Offerings webpage. I was provided a rough wireframe of what client would like the page to look, as well as an accompanying Excel Spreadsheet that contained the graphics for the updated webpage. </p>
											<p>                                            
												First, I had to clip the provided graphic images from the excel sheet and size them properly for the web page using Adobe Photoshop. Once the graphics were ready for the web, I designed a prototype of the webpage based on their provided criteria (Grid based layout, graph launching into a modal onclick, and mobile first design) and sent them a link over for review.
												</p>
											<p> 									Lastly, once the prototype was approved in review, I sent the staged web page over to QA for any last minute additions or changes.
											</p>
										<h4>The Challenges</h4>
											<p>One of the biggest issues was building it without having an approved design. Usually, the development team is provided an approved design from the web design team before building a webpage, especially for the main site. However, for this webpage, the client wanted it up and running by Freddie Mac's 50 year anniversary.</p> 
											<p> In order to overcome this challenge, I was in close communication with the client. Providing prototypes and quickly iterating on the page based on their feedback on the previous prototype.</p>
										<h4>The Result</h4>
											<p>The page launched without a hitch in preparation for Freddie Mac's anniversary. The page presented to the user was modern and easy to use on desktop and mobile. It satisfies the client's goals for the look and feel of the page, as well as it's functionality.</p>

												<h3>Strength in Stability Campaign</h3>
											</div>
											<div class="desktop col-8 col-8-medium col-12-small">
												<a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/about/company/" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/strength-and-stability-desktop.png" alt=""></a>

										<h4>The Goal</h4>
											<p>The goal for this page was to redesign the current companies' about section to reflect the changes that Freddie Mac had gone through over the past 50 years and where it was going in the future.</p>
										<h4>The Tools</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Teamsite</li>
												<li>Robohead</li>
												<li>Adobe Dreamweaver</li>
												<li>HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript</li>
												<li>Bootstrap</li>
											</ul>
										<h4>The Process</h4>
											<p>This redesign was one of the biggest projects the web development team worked on that year. In the drafting stagings of the design of the web page, the web design team, communication team, back end development, and front end development would hold bi weekly stand ups to go over prototypes from the design team and brainstorm ideas with the communications.</p>
											<p>After 4 weeks of prototyping and brainstorm, we were able to come up with a web design that was functional from a JavaScript perspective and appealing to the communication teams vision.</p>
											<p>My role in this project was to develop the content area of the webpage. Including the button interface, typography of the page, and the grid based layout.</p>
											
										<h4>The Challenges</h4>
											<p>One of the challenges that arrived during development was getting the web designs of the buttons on the page to look the same on the web.</p> 
											<p>This was my first time using the 'position' CSS property to place and overlap the inverted carrot icon on top of the button image. I was able to overcome this challenge, by puzzling out the problem and using online resources to solve my problem. However, I also reached out to one of the senior developers to review and QA my solution, before pushing it over to production.</p>
										<h4>The Result</h4>
											<p>The redesign of the Strength in Stability page, originally about the company, was received incredibly well by other employees and executives at Freddie Mac. The page is still iterated on and updated at the end of each quarterly financial period.</p>
